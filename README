Ryan Baten Advanced Graphics Project
------------------------------------
Written on an Ubuntu 16.04 system that had an nvidia graphics card

How to build and run:
---------------------
qmake
make
./project

Instructions:
-------------
Procedural Generation:
  - Look at those pretty waves. Use the comboboxes on the left to switch shaders and/or switch modes.

Heightfield approximations: 
  - The x and y sliders change where the disturbance will be added.
  - Press the add disturbance button to generate a ripple.
  - Reset resets the particles.
  - After I had plaed around with shaders to try to see the waves easily, the ones
    I found to work the best were the color shader and the black and white shader.
    Use those for best results.

Obstacle mode:
  - The center contains a square which act like an obstacle for the waves.
  - Choose a sufficiently off center disturbance point and then generate a disturbance.
  - Watch as the waves interact with the invisible obstacle.
